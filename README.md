## üöÄ Getting Started
(at the moment not production setup)

### Requirements  
- Python 3.10+
- Django 5+

### Installation

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mediahub.git
cd mediahub

# create virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# start server
python manage.py runserver
```

### Configuration
You need a `config.yaml` file in the base directory:

```yaml
libraries:
  - name: Movies
    type: movies
    path: /home/media/movies
    hidden: false
    sync: true

  - name: Family Photos
    type: pictures
    path: /home/media/family
    hidden: false
    sync: false

  - name: Bangkok Trip
    type: pictures
    path: /home/media/bangkok
    hidden: true
    sync: false

hidden_pin: "1234"
```

- `name` ... the name of the library in the GUI
- `type` ... pictures or movies
- `path` ... physical directory path
- `hidden` ... should this library be hidden by default?
- `sync` ... should this library try to use the movie database to gather the original title and poster etc.
- `hidden_pin` ... pin to unlock hidden libraries (4 digits) 

If you want to sync movie posters / titles from a movie database, please visit [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an account. Copy your API KEY and set it as environment variable.

```bash
export TMDB_API_KEY="..."
```
